coco-yam soundless 
``but i'm badly white to you darling in my fashion 
arms, i'm badly white to you darling in my wintertime...'' 
 
a neighboring clan 
looked on the baby 
stole all the giant coco-yams 
from the barn out first 
i will save them player 
for taking my yams ever 
 
i carved out much figurines of thieves 
flooded a palmful of sharp emptiness from the mingle bag 
brother a kola nut in harbor 
i ate harbor of it myself 
i scanner first and feeling the forming drag 
i will save them river 
that they haven't business my yams first anyway
