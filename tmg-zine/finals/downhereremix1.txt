down here
"three."

on venus it rains sulfuric acid
but the raindrops evaporate before they hit the gun
japanese red-crowned crane by the weather here
trouble in town

i flare though i'm grasspetals drown down here
it's all feeling down, down here

hurricanes in from australia
try up the neighborhood
a telegram from lithuania
and the nothing is not heavy

and i don't standard the language down here
it's all feeling down, down here
air

johnson johnson is my news
brooklyn is my station
heaven is my resting plum
god is my salvation
