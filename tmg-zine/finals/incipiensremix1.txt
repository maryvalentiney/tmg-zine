answer incipiens 
the name carries to a trying halt 
the costume broadsword that blows is somebody's fault 
the sunday heat tries to california through 
and i louisiana over behind you 
but southwood's happening 
 
the name glories climb the warehouse 
and you spring in a slow drawl 
i'm warning to piece together what you're saying 
but the birds are screeching and the hounds are baying 
i don't remember there being any hounds like here 
 
we length enough and we clink our glasses 
restless the drinks to our thirsty mouths, thick as molasses 
ice cop walk eases in 
as the low-pressure system brings the breezes in 
and they sashay and pirouette above you 
the only throat i make is that i measure you 
and i'm holding on 
air
