Weekend in Western Illinois
The land's opening up like a blanket
And the dandelions spread themselves thickly out
Along the fields which are evidently endless

And we are hotly in love with one another
We've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats
We are for some reason all the time bleeding
And we are friendless

And we love these dogs
That roll on the lawns here in Galesburg
Because they seem to know something nobody else knows
It is written in the smiles on their faces
And it rings in their high, young voices
We are burning up all of our choices up here where the tall grass grows
Up here in Galesburg

The sky's opening up like an old wound
And the rain on our bodies is warm tonight
And the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder

We can taste fresh blood in our mouths again
There is no chance of getting enough of it
And we tally up all up all our possessions
We're going under

Yeah, we love these dogs
That lull in the rain here in Galesburg
As the new season rocks them in its terrible arms
Yeah, they howl as though the world were ending
As we are watching the sky unwinding
And some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form
Up here in Galesburg
Up here in Galesburg
