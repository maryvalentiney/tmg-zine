Coco-Yam Song
"But I'm always true to you darling in my fashion
Yes, I'm always true to you darling in my way..."

A neighboring clan
Went on the attack
Stole all the giant coco-yams
From the barn out back
I will make them pay
For taking my yams away

I carved out little figurines of thieves
Burned a palmful of red dust from the medicine bag
Broke a kola nut in half 
I ate half of it myself
I sat back and watching the evening drag
I will make them regret
That they haven't brought my yams back yet
