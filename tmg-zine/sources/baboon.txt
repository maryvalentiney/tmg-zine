Baboon
The sun came up above the strange white plain
Blood-red flowers all wet with rain
And the spirit wasn't really willing anymore
But the flesh was very, very strong 

And I've got very little money left and I've got no sense
But I'll have none of your goddamned impudence
Sun came up above the new white fields
Everything was new again

Pure power stripped of meaning
Sky burning
Spring cleaning

Daisies on the hillside like cancer on the skin
Pretty little yellow eyes that flutter in the wind
I'd be grateful my children aren't here to see this if you'd ever seen fit to give me children

And my defenses may be working with a skeleton crew
But I'll be skinned alive before I'll take this from you
The sun came up above the ocean out west
All the colors of the rainbow

Stand up straight you can see the house leaning
Day breaking
Spring cleaning
