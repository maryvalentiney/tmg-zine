Pure Love
Hey, what's wrong with you
Hey, what are you trying to do
Because if what you have in mind
Is what I think it is, then it's not very kind
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now

Hey, what are you doing, my love
Hey, didn't I just tell you that such a thing would be over and above
What's called for in this case
Pull the ski mask away from your face
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
