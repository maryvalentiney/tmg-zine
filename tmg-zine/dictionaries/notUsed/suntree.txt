You or Your Memory 5 6 7
I checked into a bargain-priced room on La Cienega 8
Gazed out through the curtains at the parking lot
Walked down to the cornerstore just before nightfall in my bare feet
Black tarry asphalt, soft and hot
And when I came back, I spread out my supplies
On the counter by the sink, looked myself right in the eyes

St. Joseph's baby aspirin 9
Bartles & Jaymes 10
And you
Or your memory

I ducked behind the drapes when I saw the moon begin to rise
Gathered in my loose ends, switched off the light
And down there in the dark I could see the real truth about me
As clear as day, Lord, if I make it through tonight
And I will mend my ways
And walk the straight path 'til the end of my days

St. Joseph's baby aspirin
Bartles & Jaymes
And you
Or your memory

Broom People 11
'36 Hudson 12
In the garage
All sorts of junk
In the unattached spare room
Dishes in the kitchen sink
New straw for the old broom
Friends who don't have a clue
Well-meaning teachers
But down in your arms, in your arms
I am a wild creature

Floor two foot high with newspapers
White carpet thick with pet hair
Half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer
Fresh fuel for the sodium flares 13
I write down good reasons to freeze to death
In my spiral ring notebook
But in the long tresses of your hair
I am a babbling brook

This Year 14 15 16 17
I broke free on a Saturday morning
I put the pedal to the floor
Headed north on Mills Avenue 18
And listened to the engine roar

My broken house behind me and good things ahead
A girl named Kathy wants a little of my time
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
Ah-ha, listen to the engine whine

I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me

I played video games 19 in a drunken haze
I was seventeen years young
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of Scotch 20 rich on my tongue

Then Kathy showed up and we hung out
Trading swigs from the bottle all bitter and clean
Locking eyes, holding hands
Twin high-maintenance machines

I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me

I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come

I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly as you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear

There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year 21
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me
I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me 22

Dilaudid 23 24 25 26
The reception's gotten fuzzy
The delicate balance has shifted
Put on your gloves and your black pumps 27
Let's pretend the fog has lifted
Now you see me
Now you don't
Now you say you love me
Pretty soon you won't
If we get our full three score and ten 28
We won't pass this way again
So kiss me with your mouth open
Turn the tires toward the street 29
And stay sweet

All the chickens come on home to roost
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
When I see them trying to fly
'Cause you just can't do
Things your body wasn't meant to
Hike up your fishnets 30
I know you
If we live to see the other side of this
I will remember your kiss
So do it with your mouth open
And take your foot off of the brake
For Christ's sake

Dance Music 31
All right, I'm on Johnson Avenue in San Luis Obispo 32
And I'm five years old or six maybe
And indications that there's something wrong with our new house
Trip down the wire twice daily
I'm in the living room watching the Watergate hearings 33
While my stepfather yells at my mother
Launches a glass across the room, straight at her head
And I dash upstairs to take cover
Lean in close to my little record player on the floor
So this is what the volume knob's for
I listen to dance music
Dance music

OK, so look, I'm seventeen years old 34
And you're the last, best thing I got going 35
But then the special secret sickness starts to eat through you
What am I supposed to do, no way of knowing
So I follow you down your twisting alleyways
Find a few cul-de-sacs of my own
There's only one place this road ever ends up 35
And I don't want to die alone 36
Let me down, let me down, let me down gently
When the police come to get me, I'm listening to dance music
Dance music

Dinu Lipatti's Bones 37 38 39 40
We stank of hair dye and ammonia 41
We sealed ourselves away from view
You were looking at the void and seldom blinking
The best that I could do
Was to train my eyes on you

We scaled the hidden hills beneath the surface
Scraped our fingers bloody on the stones
And built a little house that we could live in
Out of Dinu Lipatti's bones

We kept our friends at bay all summer long
Treated the days as if they'd kill us if they could
Ringing out the hours like blood-drenched bedsheets
To keep wintertime at bay
But December showed up anyway

There was no money, it was money that you wanted
I went downtown, sold off most of what I owned
And we raised a tower to broadcast all our dark dreams
From Dinu Lipatti's bones 42

Up the Wolves 43 44 45
There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
That you're gonna find really difficult to forgive

There's gonna come a day when you feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch, higher than the air
Just when that day is coming, who can say, who can say

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home 46

We're gonna commandeer the local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's been going on
And they will shake their heads, and wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions, and by daybreak we'll be gone

I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
I'm gonna bribe the officials, I'm gonna kill all the judges
It's gonna take you people years to recover from all of the damage

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home

Lion's Teeth 47 48 49
The king of the jungle
Was asleep in his car
When your chances fall in your lap like that
You gotta recognize them for what they really are

Nobody in this house
Wants to own up to the truth
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
Grab hold of one long, sharp tooth

And hold on
For dear life
I hold on

Well, course he wakes up
His paw hits the horn
I am gonna regret 50
The day that I was born

And then Mom rushes out to the driveway
My sister too 51
Everyone screaming
I am dreaming of you

I hold on
For dear life
I hold on

And my arms get sore
And my palms start to sweat
And the tears roll down my face
'Til my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet

In come the cops
They blowtorch the doors
I start wailing
The lion roars

There's no good way to end this
Anyone can see
There's this great big you
And little old me

And we hold on
For dear life 52
We hold on
We hold on

Hast Thou Considered the Tetrapod 53 54 55 56
You are sleeping off your demons
When I come home
Spittle bubbling on your lips
Fine white foam
I am young and I am good
It's a hot Southern California day
If I wake you up
There will be hell to pay
And alone in my room
I am the last of a lost civilization
And I vanish into the dark
And rise above my station
Rise above my station

But I do wake you up, and when I do
You blaze down the hall and you scream
I'm in my room with the headphones on
Deep in the dream chamber
And then I'm awake and I'm guarding my face
Hoping you don't break my stereo
Because it's the one thing that I couldn't live without
And so I think about that, and then I sort of black out
Held under these smothering waves
By your strong and thick-veined hand
But one of these days
I'm gonna wriggle up on dry land

Magpie 57 58 59
Feed the kittens in the kitchen
Set food out for the strays
Try hard to do your best
The magpie will have his way

Fill your mouth with berries
By the full light of the moon
Work all night if you have to
The magpie comes at noon

Shore up the crucifixes
Above the archways and the doors 60
The magpie will come at midday
And you will go down on all fours

And when the cherries white with blossoms
Be ready and be brave
And remember what we had here
When there was something left to save

Song for Dennis Brown 61 62 63 64
On the day that Dennis Brown's lung collapsed, spring rain was misting down on Kingston 65
And down at the harbor, local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment
And for a while there it was chaos
As they handcuffed and then roughed up some sailors

On the day my lung collapses
It's not gonna be much different

On the day that Dennis Brown's habits caught up with him, schoolchildren sang in choirs
And out behind the Chinese restaurants, guys were jumping into dumpsters
And the stench was overbearing
But they were past the point of caring

On the day my habits catch up with me
I'll be down among the jumpers

And when the birds come home in spring, 66 we will fill them full of buckshot
And jets of contaminated blood will cloud the rivers and the lakes
It took all the coke in town
To bring down Dennis Brown

On the day my lung collapses
We'll see just how much it takes

Love Love Love 67 68
King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong 69
And Joseph's brother sold him down the river for a song 70
And Sonny Liston rubbed some Tiger Balm into his glove 71
Some things you do for money, and some you do for love, love, love

Raskolnikov felt sick, but he couldn't say why 72
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
Some things you'll do for money, and some you'll do for fun
But the things you do for love are gonna come back to you one by one 73

Love, love is gonna lead you by the hand
Into a white and soundless place 74
Now we see things as in a mirror dimly
Then we shall see each other face to face 75

And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain 76
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above
Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love, love, love

Pale Green Things 77
Got up before dawn
Went down to the racetrack
Riding with the windows down
Shortly after your first heart attack
You parked behind the paddock
Cracking asphalt underfoot
Coming up through the cracks
Pale green things
Pale green things

We watched the horses run their workouts
You held your stopwatch in your left hand
And a racing form beneath your arm
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land 78
Sometimes I'll meet you out there
Lonely and frightened
Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves
Pale green things
Pale green things

My sister called at 3 AM
Just last December
She told me how you died at last, at last
And that morning at the racetrack was one thing I remembered
I turned it over in my mind
Like a living Chinese finger trap 79
Seaweed and Indiana sawgrass 80
Pale green things
Pale green things
